\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
\begin{quote}
Creativity cannot exist in a vacuum; it develops through feedback,
learning, reflection and social interaction with others. However, this perspective
has been relatively under-investigated in computational creativity
research, which typically examines systems that operate
individually. 
% We develop a set of requirements for creativity systems
% that can incorporate communication and give and receive
% feedback. 
% As a thought experiment to test these ideas, 
We develop a thought experiment showing how structured dialogues can help develop the
creative aspects of computer poetry.
Centrally in this approach, we ask questions of a poem, inviting it to tell us in what way it may be considered a ``creative making.''

% in what way can CC enhance the human workshop?

\textbf{Keywords}: computer poetry, social creativity, flowcharts, Writer's Workshops

% Study papers
% These will be papers which draw on allied fields such as psychology, philosophy, cognitive science or mathematics;
% or which appeal to broader areas of Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science in general;
% or which appeal to studies of the field of Computational Creativity as a whole.
% The emphasis here is on presenting enlightening novel perspectives related to the building,
% assessment or deployment of systems ranging from autonomously creative systems to creativity support tools.
% Such perspectives can be presented through a variety of approaches including ethnographical studies,
% thought experiments, comparison with studies of human creativity and surveys.

%% Outline of the paper and main points in each section:
\input{introduction} % introduce and define social creativity
\input{background} % Advocating and explaining social creativity in cc, as the importance of social engagement with creative artefacts as a crucial part of creativity. Contextualising this argument in the case study of computer poetry
\input{philosophy_and_methods} 
% Methods: introducing our methodology, our lab rats and the concept of writers workshops
% Philosophy: introduce the concepts from aesthetic philosophy that tell us how to read poems
