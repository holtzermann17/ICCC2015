	Abstract = {This paper reports a computer program to generate novel designs for the arrangement of furniture within a simulated room. It is based on the engagement- reflection computer model of the creative processes. During engagement the system generates material in the form of sequences of actions (e.g. change the colours of the walls, include some furniture in the room, modify their colour, and so on) guided by content and knowledge constraints. During reflection, the system evaluates the composition produced so far and, if it is necessary, modifies it. We discuss the implementation of the system and some of its most salient features, especially the use of a computational model for creativity in the terrain of design. We argue that this kind of model opens new possibilities for the simulation of the design processes as well as the development of tools.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a novel computational approach to the study of creativity. In particular, it discusses a modeling framework that addresses the worth of ideas ascribed by agents embedded in a social world. The triple objective of this system is to improve our understanding of how ideas may emerge from a few individuals, how social interaction may result in the ascription of value to new ideas, and how culture may evolve through time, transforming or replacing dominant or consensual ideas. The proposed system encompasses commonalities in existing theories of creativity, and suggests future theoretical directions that can be explored via simulation. [Our computational approach to the study of creativity addresses the worth of ideas ascribed by societies. This system enables the operation of theories regarding the interaction of individuals, societies and ideas.]},
