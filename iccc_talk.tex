%% \begin{quote}
%% Creativity cannot exist in a vacuum; it develops through feedback,
%% learning, reflection and social interaction with others. However, this perspective
%% has been relatively under-investigated in computational creativity
%% research, which typically examines systems that operate
%% individually. 
%% % We develop a set of requirements for creativity systems
%% % that can incorporate communication and give and receive
%% % feedback. 
%% % As a thought experiment to test these ideas, 
%% We develop a thought experiment showing how structured dialogues can help develop the
%% creative aspects of computer poetry.
%% Centrally in this approach, we ask questions of a poem, inviting it to tell us in what way it may be considered a ``creative making.''

%% % in what way can CC enhance the human workshop?

% Study papers
% These will be papers which draw on allied fields such as psychology, philosophy, cognitive science or mathematics;
% or which appeal to broader areas of Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science in general;
% or which appeal to studies of the field of Computational Creativity as a whole.
% The emphasis here is on presenting enlightening novel perspectives related to the building,
% assessment or deployment of systems ranging from autonomously creative systems to creativity support tools.
% Such perspectives can be presented through a variety of approaches including ethnographical studies,
% thought experiments, comparison with studies of human creativity and surveys.

\section*{Scene 1}

\begin{dialogue}
\direct{The workshop participants have gathered to discuss the paper
  ``Computational Poetry Workshop: Making Sense of Work in Progress.''}

\smallskip

\cg{If you could move these chairs together in a sort of circle\ldots}

\direct{They move the chairs into more of a semi-circle, so that the
  audience can see them too.}

\aj{If we can all see each other that should be fine.}

\cg{I guess you've all had a chance to read the paper already?}

\direct{The reviewers nod and say ``yeah.''}

\cg{Joe, could you give us a quick summary and highlight the things
  you're most interested in getting feedback about?  I guess, given
  the content of the paper, you're pretty much familiar with the way
  this sort of thing works, but, just to be clear, once you're done
  with that quick presentation, we'll give you feedback, and you
  should just take notes. OK?}

\medskip

\direct{Sometime around during the above speech, the title slide
  should go away, and be replaced by a blank white screen.}

\end{dialogue}

\newpage

\begin{dialogue}
\direct{As \refer{Joe} speaks, the pieces of text in italics will appear
  one by one as bullet points on the screen behind the workshop participants.
  That slide stays on screen throughout the rest of Scene 1 (\refer{Joe}'s monologue).}

\begin{mdframed}
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{How has the social dimension of creativity been
  explored in CC to date?}
\item \emph{Let's give artefacts more agency, design computer programs
  with more autonomy, and focus research effort on understanding
  creative evolution.}
\item \emph{Let's ask: ``How a created artefact can tell us about its own
  making?''}
\item \emph{A theory of poetics rooted in the making of
  boundary-crossing objects and processes.}
\item \emph{The paper is claiming that workshops are suitable
  environments for autonomous learning and development of the creative
  process.}
\end{itemize}
\end{mdframed}

\jc{Sure.  OK, so, the paper is called ``Computational Poetry
  Workshop: Making Sense of Work in Progress.''  It's for ICCC'15, the
  International Conference on Computational Creativity.  It's already
  been accepted for publication but I'd like to improve it so that it's
  a bit more clear, since the reviewers expressed some doubts.  The
  paper starts out by looking at \emph{how the social dimension of
    creativity has been explored in CC to date.}  It basically says
  that the ideas of social interaction, feedback, and evaluation have
  frequently been discussed in CC, but that implementation and
  theorisation around these topics have been more limited.  It then
  goes on to suggest that we what should do is \emph{give artefacts
    more agency, design computer programs with more autonomy, and
    focus research effort on understanding creative evolution.}  I
  want to check with you if that part is clear, because the
  perspective isn't exactly traditional.  The underlying idea is much
  more broadly applicable than CC, and it asks: \emph{``How a created
    artefact can tell us about its own making?''}  The paper takes
  this idea and runs with it a bit, to suggest that in principle
  computers can engage in dialogue, with, and about, poems.  Out of this comes the
  more profound idea of \emph{a theory of poetics rooted in the making
    of boundary-crossing objects and processes.}  That sounds a bit
  abstract, so I want to make sure it's coming across well.  After
  presenting these more theoretical ideas, the paper makes some
  initial steps towards a computational simulation.  It develops a
  thought experiment that imagines an improved version of the FloWr system
  that's being developed in the CCG group at Goldsmiths being used
  to run ``writers workshops'' for computer poetry.  There are lots of
  technical facilities that could make that easier, but the main thing
  I want to get feedback from you on today is what you think about the
  core idea of the workshop approach in a computing context.  \emph{The paper is claiming that
    workshops are suitable environments for autonomous learning and
    development of the creative process.}  Finally, it makes some sort
  of political claims about dialogue within CC, but the basic thrust
  here is that we should be getting our computer programs talking to
  each other.  I'm curious to know what you guys think about that.
  And, yeah, that's it.}

\section*{Scene 2}

\direct{The projection switches to a blank screen again.  \refer{Joe} takes
  notes on what people are saying, and these notes accumulate on the
  screen.  This should resemble a poem by the end of the scene.}

\cg{Thanks Joe.  Does anyone want to sum up what they think the paper
  is about? \direct{Looks around.}  I guess I'll start.  The paper
  studies how social interaction through dialogue can be applied to
  computational creativity processes.  It uses poetry generation as an
  example and aims to develop a ``thought experiment'' in this
  domain.}

\tl{I'd say it's basically a study about how to use social creativity
  to generate poems. The proposal consists on using the Writer’s
  Workshop model to maintain a dialogue between different poetry
  generators and poetry critics in order to improve the final poem.
  In the paper, there are presented different questions that could be
  asked by a person when reading a poem, and the questions that a
  computer could ask.  Then, the results are compared.  Finally, the
  proposal is applied showing a hypothetical adapted design of the
  FloWr system with a human critic and a poetry generator.}

\cg{Thanks Teresa, I think that's a good summary.  You're right, the
  questions that people and computers can ask form a pretty central
  part of the paper.  Maybe that has to do with the ``theory of
  poetics that is rooted in the making of boundary-crossing objects
  and processes'' although frankly that's still pretty abstract for
  me.  Anna, what do you think?  What does the paper accomplish?}

\aj{Well, first of all, I think this paper makes a reasonable start
  toward describing a workshop-style collaboration on writing (and
  reading) poetry.  It does only preliminary work toward this, but
  raises a lot of interesting questions.  For example, it made me
  wonder how a workshop approach differs from more traditional peer
  review -- if at all?  Like Teresa said, it seems like the paper is
  making the case that the workshop is not just useful for reviewing
  things after they're created but for helping create them in the
  first place.  Although there is some interesting tension there.  If
  the emphasis is on poetry generation it would probably be useful to
  include a more thorough review of systems like Slant (by Montfort,
  P\'erez y P\'erez and Harrell), which is a blackboard-based
  multi-agent system.  But I can see that the workshop idea is a bit
  different from more traditional multi-agent systems like that one.}

\tl{I think it's really nice to see the discussion of process as the
  content of a poem, not because everyone would agree that this is
  correct but because it asserts a particular, deliberate perspective
  on poetry.  Christian, I think what the philosophical ideas are
  saying is that the poem is a sort of dialogue that the reader gets
  involved with -- but I agree that could be said a lot more simply.
  Another thing is that the way in which the agency is split up on
  page 4 (a separate counting agent and breathing agent) of course
  does not represent the different perspectives of workshop
  participants.  A workshop where everyone has the same sort of
  expertise, along these lines, could be successful as a computer
  program.  But if it is very culturally homogeneous, it's not going
  to say anything very interesting.  My question is how this model can
  include cultural and idiosyncratic differences in ways that are
  given first-order representations, given how important those
  differences are.}

\cg{OK. Now I think we're getting into the question ``What could be
  improved about the paper?''  So, what do you think about that?}

\tl{To be honest, it is sometimes difficult to read.  I also think a
  better example with more participants could be useful to understand
  the proposal.  In fact, at some point quite a few more examples and
  experiments will really be needed, to really evaluate the proposal,
  but I understand that the current version is a study paper rather
  than a technical paper.}

\aj{Following on from what Teresa said, my only concern here is that
  too little has been done in terms of modelling and system-building
  for others to effectively build upon, or argue for or against the
  applicability of this kind of design in a computing context.  If you
  want to be more computationally convincing without building a
  concrete implementation, I was thinking you could break the process
  into phases like these: \direct{\refer{Anna} refers to her notes,
    and indicates each step clearly, with a gesture or number;
    \refer{Joe} should make sure to capture each of these points in
    his on-screen notes.} \direct{1} Building a model of the text,
  \direct{2} Tagging elements of interest, \direct{3} Generating
  feedback based on assocations drawn between these elements,
  \direct{4} Asking for more information to understand the feedback,
  \direct{5} Creating rationale for the feedback and, on the part of
  the author, \direct{6} Updating the point of view.  To be honest,
  any one of those steps could probably be a PhD project, but with a
  division of labour like that, it starts to look more computationally
  feasible.}

\cg{I also find it a bit hard to see the computational focus in the
  current paper, although maybe that's because it's doing double duty
  as a kind of manifesto.  I think it is certainly presenting a very
  interesting challenge and food for thought for later discussion and
  more precise elaboration.  Oh, and there are also a few typos, I can
  pass you a list. Any other comments?}

\direct{Looks around, but people are signalling they're done.}

\cg{Joe, do you have any questions about the discussion so far?}

\jc{\direct{A bit hurt because he's imagining the philosophical ideas
    haven't come across very well.}  No, thanks, I think that's all
  pretty clear.}

\cg{I think there's a lot there, but -- if I can make a final summary
  comment -- I think it would be good if the work was presented with
  some more structure.  If not in the paper itself, then at the
  conference: a well structured and concrete presentation, perhaps
  following an example that looks into the role of different agents
  could help spark the discussion.  \direct{Breaking the 4th wall.}
  With that, let's take some questions and comments from the
  audience.}
